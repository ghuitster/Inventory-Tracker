-Moved the list of Items and Products to the ICommand interface rather than in each Command object.
-Added the executed and undone stacks to the AddItemBatchController, TransferItemBatchController and RemoveItemBatchController.
-Changed the ICommand interface to the abstract class Command.
-Reworked the reports. Now, all report classes are of an abstract Report type, which accepts a builder
-Reworked the builders. There are now two builders: HTML and PDF. A Builder is passed to a Report. The Report then uses the builder to make either an HTML or PDF report. (There is no test builder because the reports can be verified through their in-memory object representations)
