Changes to Phase 1 Design

We added the pre/post conditions in our javadocs. We added maps to the Inventory class for help with report generation. We created a better class hierarchy for ThreeMonthSupply and UnitSize.  We also added our custom exceptions.  We also added the transfer method to ProductContainer class. We also looked into govern by visibility concept. It looks like this concept will not work the way we would want it to.  We changed our classes to represent the more normal composite.  This will also fix the cohesion problem we were having with the ProductContainer class. We made a Description class for Product. We created a layer for persistence.
